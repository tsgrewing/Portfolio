                      I grew up in Mt. Juliet, TN but moved after graduating high school in 2005. I went to college in Sioux Falls, SD, studying modern foreign language and philosophy. During college I started working at a local coffee roasting company, and in 2011 I took the next step in my coffee career and moved to Seattle to roast for Stumptown Coffee. In 2014 I moved to Chicago, and lived there until 2017, mostly working in the specialty coffee and craft beer industries. My wife and I moved to South Florida in early 2017. We'll be moving back to the Nashville area at the end of June.

                      My name is Tony, and I'm making the My introduction to coding was an HTML class in middle school, we mostly just covered the basics, but those stuck with me. A few years later I dove a little deeper into web design by using css to personalize a myspace page. I started out by just trying to make my page look less boring, but ended up spending hours and hours changing anything and everything I could until it barely resembled a myspace page at all. Unfortunately I did not really continue with any sort of coding after high school, and most of what I had learned eventually faded from my memory.

                      Working for mostly small businesses has given me the opportunity to work on a wide variety of projects, and I have found myself tasked with maintaining existing websites and online stores fairly often. Keeping pages up to date and adding/removing elements without compromising the site's overall styling meant I spent a lot of time looking through existing code, searching online for short tutorials, and a lot of trial and error. I recently decided it was time to take the leap and start seriously working on my coding knowledge and skills. Looking forward to expanding my existing knowledge and learning some new skills.
